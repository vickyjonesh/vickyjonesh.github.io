<p>At the core of IPM is the desire to decrease pesticide use and human incursion into the environment unless monitoring of pest populations suggests intervention is needed.

<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can rapidly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered therefore ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For example, a rich area likely will have a lot of large, pricey homes, so pest control expenses could be greater there since there's more territory for a pest control company to cover in among those houses. </p>
<p>Biological control includes making use of a pest's natural opponents (e.g., predators, pathogens, parasites and parasitoids), to control pest abundance. The term "IPM," under various authors have actually promoted for the principle of integrating, the complete selection of pest management practices with production objectives in a total systemic approach. These control techniques can be very effective and cost-effective and present little to no threat to individuals or the environment.</p>
