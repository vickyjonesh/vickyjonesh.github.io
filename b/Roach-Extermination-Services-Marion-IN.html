<p>The human reaction depends on the importance of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to totally remove the pest. Current experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be utilized for key examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and avoidance programs that rely on numerous simultaneous techniques to obtain the preferred outcome.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Using helpful creatures such as insects or fungi that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is placed on how natural opponents function and how we can promote their natural efficiency. Consider soil or substrate health not just in the biological sense: very little presence of soil borne pests or diseases.
