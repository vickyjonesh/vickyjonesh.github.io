A single spotting of any pest in a warehouse during an audit can imply a lot of damage to the reputation-wise and company-financial. All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your valuables with hazardous chemicals, destroy the air quality in your house or business, potentially infect food and other perishables, and only eliminates pests at the surface area of the problem.</p>

Focusing generally on long-term pest prevention, a successful IPM program makes use of a mix of control techniques consisting of biological control, environment adjustment, changes to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>The realization that specific insects are carriers of organisms producing diseases in man has produced insistent demands by the informed public that control methods be established and utilized effectively to avoid the spread of such pests.
