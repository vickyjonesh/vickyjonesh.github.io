<p>Consider alternative methods (aside from pesticides) to make your home and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you take actions to keep pests from becoming an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can hold up against pest attacks, utilizing disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from going into a structure. Current quests for effective, safe, and long lasting pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards advancement of brand-new and better items with which to change traditional hazardous pesticides.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which enabled local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will make sure favourable financial condition, ecological and social consequences 13 and is applicable to most farming, public health and facility pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine tracking indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control procedures.</p>
