<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a affordable and ecologically benign pest control method preferably fit for both small and large farmers worldwide. As soon as termites have entered a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from assessment and tracking) are used to make pest control decisions based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>One ofthe greatest advantages of natural approaches is that they don't include the use of toxicchemicals. Select a pesticide that is pest specific, if available; remember, do not kill the advantageous insects. But the exterminators not just assist you in eliminating the pests from your house, but they make sure the pests will not return. IPM worries the use of non-chemical control approaches, such as exemption or trapping, prior to chemical choices.</p>
