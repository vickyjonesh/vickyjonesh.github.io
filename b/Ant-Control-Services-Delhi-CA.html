Testing may entail taking a look at plants and tape-recording the number of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps may be used to capture the pest types to estimate pest abundance.</p>
<p>Biological Control: Using helpful creatures such as insects or fungis that damage the weeds. Less emphasis is placed on how natural opponents function and how we can promote their natural effectiveness. Think about soil or substrate health not only in the biological sense: minimal existence of soil borne pests or illness.
