<p>Objective Statement: The objective of Mosquito Control is to provide Leon County citizens with efficient and environmentally sound mosquito control services. Much like us, pests require food, water, and shelter to make it through, and if they can't find these in your house, it's likely they'll go somewhere else. If they can not enter it, pests can not make it through without food and will not infest a building.
