<p>Chemical pest control, especially space fumigation, tends to work best for extreme problems. This includes practices that reduce pest issues by reducing the conditions that favour their existence (water, shelter, food). Genetically modified (GM) crops can make a significant contribution to this choice of host-plant resistance.

A long time just one off treatment is inadequate to remove the pests completely and for this reason it may require multiple treatments, so naturally that will impact the overall expenses and rates of pest control services.</p>
