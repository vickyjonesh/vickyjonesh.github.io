<p>Biological control includes the use of a pest's natural enemies (e.g., predators, parasites, pathogens and parasitoids), to control pest abundance. The term "IPM," under various authors have advocated for the concept of incorporating, the complete array of pest management practices with production objectives in a total systemic method. These control approaches can be cost-efficient and really effective and present little to no threat to people or the environment.</p>
