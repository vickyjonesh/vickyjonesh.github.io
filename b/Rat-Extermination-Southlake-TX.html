<p>It utilizes a combination of practices and control approaches with the aim of preventing issues from reducing the requirement and occurring for pesticide intensive activities such as broadacre spraying. Likewise, consider policies and procedures that might unsuspectingly present pests: storage practices and devices, upkeep, and housekeeping practices. The term was later expanded to welcome collaborated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (13 ). Subsequently, under the term IPM," numerous authors have advocated the concept of including the complete variety of pest management practices together with production objectives into an overall systems technique. </p>
