<p>Pest Management fact sheets Data on arthropod pest abundance, area within the greenhouse, and population trends (increases, decreases, or stable) help determine the effectiveness of pest management tactics. IPM approaches include the intro of predators and particular parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, consisting of insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management means careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of suitable steps that dissuade the advancement of populations of damaging organisms and keep the use of plant defense items and other kinds of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise threats to human health and the environment.</p>

<p>In recommendation to the principle of incorporating using other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later widened to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance. </p>
<p>Kaolin particle films used in organic farming may control some pests, however can negatively impact natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural opponent populations, but a higher variety of natural opponents does not constantly result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ).
