<p>Pest Management fact sheets Data on arthropod pest abundance, area within the greenhouse, and population trends (increases, decreases, or stable) help determine the effectiveness of pest management tactics. IPM approaches include the intro of predators and particular parasitoids (species of wasps that are internal parasites of other insects). The generic term pesticides" can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, consisting of insecticides, rodenticides, herbicides, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.</p>
<p>Integrated pest management means careful consideration of all available plant protection methods and subsequent integration of suitable steps that dissuade the advancement of populations of damaging organisms and keep the use of plant defense items and other kinds of intervention to levels that are economically and ecologically justified and reduce or minimise threats to human health and the environment.</p>

<p>Kaolin particle films used in organic farming may control some pests, however can negatively impact natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (MarkÃ³ et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural opponent populations, but a higher variety of natural opponents does not constantly result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ).
