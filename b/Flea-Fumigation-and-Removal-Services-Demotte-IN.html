<p>The advantages of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes the use of living organisms to control a pest population. Do not mix pesticides. There are four major elements in the new IPM design that attend to various pest management options, the knowledge, and resources the grower has to resolve the pest issue, preparation and organization of information to take suitable management actions, and maintaining excellent interaction to acquire and distribute understanding about pests and their management.</p>
<p>The decision of the proper cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides harmful to many insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life phases. </p>
<p>Correctly determine pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of various control alternatives, pest biology and damage capacity, and suitability of available resources enables the grower to decide appropriate for their circumstance. Greenhouses offer an ideal environment (e.g., temperature and light) for various biological control representatives or natural opponents consisting of parasitoids, predators, and entomopathogenic nematodes.</p>
