<p>Fall is back, and winter season is near; thank goodness!. Extremely impressed with the professional method of Sunlight Pest Control team, my house was terribly damaged by termite but they have done excellent job and they were very courteous. Diseases, weeds, and insects can cause expensive and permanent damage to livestock and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a large number of domestic manufacturers, formulators, service, providers, and providers.</p>
<p>This enables the choice of natural opponents that are more efficient or easier to propagate. The pest control operator need to be able to supply information about the chemical, such as the material safety information sheet. Natural control involves the improvement of naturally taking place pest management approaches to fight pests like using helpful insects and diseases.</p>

<p>There are various pest management techniques to suppress pests. Integrated Pest Management is a decision-making procedure for managing pests in an effective, economical and ecologically sound method.

<p>Biological control has actually been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest issues, classical biological control method is typically utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been successfully utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>The worldwide estimates vary in magnitude, however it is thought approximately 25% of crops are lost to illness and pests, such as insects, fungi and other plant pathogens (FAO Crop Prospects and Food Scenario 2009). Applications of pesticides must reach their desired targets. But there are a lot of pest control companies out there in Chandigarh and they all have various level of quality and service requirement, so naturally there charge differently.</p>
