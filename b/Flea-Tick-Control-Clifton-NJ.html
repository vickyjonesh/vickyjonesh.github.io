<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your house uninviting to them. However family pests can also be a danger to your household. When trying to find a place to infest, pests choose to conceal in a place that provides food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is much easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (multiple crops).</p>
<p>Likewise, consider how the variety of plants to be grown in the very same location might affect ease of pesticide applications and spread of disease. Pest control pertains to non-lethal methods too, such as keeping the area tidy and totally free of any food debris or other attractants, sealing up entry methods such as cracks in walls or the space in between the bottom of a door and the flooring.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle movies used in natural farming might control some pests, but can adversely impact natural enemies and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may encourage natural opponent populations, but a higher number of natural opponents does not constantly result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use fossil fuels and indirectly have a negative influence on the environment.</p>
