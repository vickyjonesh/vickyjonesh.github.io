<p>The term "integrated" was thus associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had actually reached a level (the economic threshold) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the expense of the control measures.</p>
