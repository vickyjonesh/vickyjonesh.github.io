<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to intrusive pest problems, classical biological control method is normally used where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control strategy that has been efficiently used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>Management of trap and nursery crops and surrounding environment is also included to divert insect attack far from the crop. Controlling pests can be done in numerous ways but an efficient method is to clear out the bugs frequently.
