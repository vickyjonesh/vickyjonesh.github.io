<p>It is an ecosystem approach to crop production and defense that integrates different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and minimise the use of pesticides. IPM coordinates making use of pest biology, environmental details, and readily available technology to prevent unacceptable levels of pest damage by the most cost-effective methods, while lessening threat to individuals, property, resources, and the environment.</p>
