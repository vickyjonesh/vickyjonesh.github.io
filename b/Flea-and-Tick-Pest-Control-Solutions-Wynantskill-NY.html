<p>There are different pest management tactics to reduce pests.

<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal dosages of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down development and feeding and are subject to higher parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). To put it simply, an effective, nondisruptive way to handle a moderate beet armyworm outbreak may be to retard its development and damage while providing the parasitoids time to work, therefore reinforcing the parasitoids' impact throughout subsequent generations.</p>
