<p>We got 195 explain of 200 in Integrated Pest Management. Pests are drawn in to a number of areas that can offer any of thefollowing: food, water, shelter or all 3. If much of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides must be used as the last hope, in concept, sometimes they are the first line of defense to avoid the area-wide spread of certain endemic or invasive pests and diseases or to safeguard the seed and transplants from typical and relentless pest problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses a number of the very same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
