Trap crops are planted to attract and hold pest insects where they can be handled more efficiently and prevent or minimize their motion onto important crops. Schedules are used to categorize pesticides and to control the availability of a product to the public. Termites need moisture for their survival, hence damp walls, leakage and water seepage are like open invites for them.</p>
