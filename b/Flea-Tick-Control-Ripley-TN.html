<p>The determination of the proper cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest.

<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the concept of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was broadened to include all methods. This chapter goes over various approaches to preserve pest insects at tolerable levels or in other words integrated pest management (IPM).
