Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a holistic technique to sustainable crop protection that concentrates on handling insects, weeds and diseases through a combination of cultural, physical, biological and chemical approaches that are cost effective, ecologically sound and socially acceptable.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and reduce insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, correct irrigation and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM thinks about the community as a whole and considers a balanced mix of the abovementioned control methods to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so unbearable at times that the only option left is to work with a regional pest control company to eradicate pests. The technician will typically spray pesticides around the border of numerous spaces if an expert pest control firm is under agreement to an organization. Thus, incorporated pest management indicates that areawide and long-term techniques can be important. </p>
