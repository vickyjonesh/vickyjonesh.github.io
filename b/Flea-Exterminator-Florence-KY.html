<p>There are numerous pest control companies located all over the city, that is why, is important to know which one is the very best in order to avoid being cheated by any mediocre company. Household pests can include insects such as cockroaches, mosquitoes and flies, or rodents like mice or rats.

<p>Biological control has been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address invasive pest problems, classical biological control technique is generally used where natural enemies from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and launched in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>Natural opponents can be effective, and pesticides (chemical compounds for controlling pests) are just utilized when alternative options do not produce the necessary outcome.
