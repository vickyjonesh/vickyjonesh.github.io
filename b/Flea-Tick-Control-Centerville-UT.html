<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" evolved over a period of about ten years, generally amongst researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools.

So, whether you have termites chewing up your wood beams and door frames or ants that are eating your dog's food, service technicians can develop a custom strategy that will eradicate your pest issue and safeguard you from future infestations.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production applies many of the same principles as IPM however restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
<p>If left to their own devices, pests can become an expensive problem for your business. If more monitoring, identifications and action limits suggest that less dangerous controls are not working, then extra pest control methods would be utilized, such as targeted spraying of pesticides. However excellent the outcomes of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) may be, it is just reasonable to state that worldwide, its implementation in agriculture is still in its infancy, and we are a long way from understanding everything that goes on around the crops we grow for food.</p>
