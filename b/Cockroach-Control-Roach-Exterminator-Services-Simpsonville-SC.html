<p>Ultimately a stage is reached at which pesticide use is decreased with a concurrent boost in the amount of time and management skills that are dedicated to IPM operations (Fig. Nevertheless, a decision to do nothing perhaps is the most desirable state of an IPM program in which forces of nature are identified as, per se, efficient in attaining sufficient pest population policy.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered therefore becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).

<p>When saved for a long time, stored item pests are most likely to be in a food ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food item. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, no matter requirement, is not IPM.
