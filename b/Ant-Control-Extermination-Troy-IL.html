<p>In the past, discussions of Integrated Pest Management for libraries and archives have typically concentrated on the disinfestation of known pest problems in collections. I have actually already written the tentative rates for different pest control services in Chandigarh below. Integrated Pest Management or IPM, as it is frequently understood, is a system of managing pests which is developed to be sustainable.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was hence synonymous with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied just after routine monitoring showed that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would surpass the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest issues, classical biological control approach is typically utilized where natural enemies from the native region of the intrusive pest are imported, increased, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has actually been successfully used versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
<p>The choice to utilize an insecticide, or take some other action, versus an insect infestation needs an understanding of the level of damage or insect invasion a crop can endure without an inappropriate financial loss. PCPs are educated, trained, and certified in the safest and most efficient methods to remove particular pests.
