<p>Because the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical market to indicate virtually anything a specialist wants it to suggest, Beyond Pesticides has welcomed the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus practitioners require to have -emphasizing the more comprehensive ecology of pest management and avoiding harmful chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
<p>For some tasks, pest control workers use a combination of pest management methods, a practice referred to as integrated pest management. The foundation of an effective IPM program is a schedule of routine evaluations. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though contested by some as a valid procedure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) despite the augmentation of pest control.</p>
<p>Biological pest control procedures make the most of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes preliminary job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and dynamics of pests and natural enemies helps to prevent unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control professionals even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
<p>IPM takes an ecological approach to selecting control techniques by integrating a variety of chemical and non-chemical control strategies in such a way that minimizes threat to people and the environment. Full service - Whether you require reliable upkeep services, a fast emergency situation reaction, training in pest awareness, or examinations by our professional technical team, we can offer all the assistance you need. </p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural opponents and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (several crops in the exact same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
