Chemical control generally describes using synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). Nevertheless, to be technically accurate, chemical control must consist of artificial chemicals as well as chemicals of microbial or botanical origin.</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Publications to learn about low-impact methods of pest control that decrease pesticide usage and exposure. When you hire a pest control company, you are free to spend that time doing other crucial things.

<p>This approach of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in current years considering that fire eliminates helpful insects along with the pests and can have an unfavorable influence on the soil. To minimize potential damage to useful insects, limit your spraying to little areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "refuges" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
