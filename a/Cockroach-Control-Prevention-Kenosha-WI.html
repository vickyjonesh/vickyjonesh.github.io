<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Living in a house surrounded by insects is a horror! The approaches typically involve using harsh chemicals to get rid of the undesired pests. All available methods of insect-pest management and control must be considered. Environmental influences like dry spell stress influences pest management recommendations. This handbook becomes part of a training course on Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Sustainable biological, other and physical non-chemical techniques need to be preferred to chemical methods if they supply satisfactory pest control.</p>
<p>Do not keep a lot of plants or haphazard packages of papers as moisture and cellulose draw in termites. I have been working with Animal & Bug Pest Management for several years; I say "with" because it has actually been a true collaboration in servicing the requirements of the neighborhoods I manage.
