<p>Effective, less risky pest controls are picked first, consisting of highly targeted chemicals, such as scents to interrupt pest mating, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is frequently among the most essential actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the procedure of evaluating an IPM program and the results it has actually generated.</p>
