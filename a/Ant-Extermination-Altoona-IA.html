Members of all departments or locations must be consisted of on the IPPM committee, which monitors the collection of pest tracking data and the application of specific control and prevention programs.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the most safe for other organisms and for soil, air, and water quality; usage pesticides in bait stations rather than sprays; or spot-spray a few weeds rather of a whole area.
