Crop losses due to arthropods, weeds, and diseases, though disputed by some as a valid measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the climax of pest control.</p>

A few of these elements are intrinsic to crop production while making the environment less favourable for survival, development and recreation of pest types.</p>
