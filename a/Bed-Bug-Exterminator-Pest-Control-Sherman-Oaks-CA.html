Chemical controls were to be used only after routine tracking suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the economic limit) that needed treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the cost of the control measures.</p>
<p>With IPM you'll utilize the most selective pesticide that will get the job done and be the best for other organisms and for air, water, and soil quality; use pesticides in bait stations instead of sprays; or spot-spray a couple of weeds instead of a whole location. Due to any number of reasons, including those discussed in the Chemical and Cultural sections, compromising the effectiveness of natural opponents often allows possible pest organisms to experience virtually unregulated population development and enables them to reach pest status.</p>
