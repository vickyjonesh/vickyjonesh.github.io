	<meta name="description" content="Mice Pest Control in Henrietta NY - Net economic losses for non-IPM techniques have been documented in an annual revenue report (Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research 11 CGIAR), 2010; Farrar et al., 2015 ). Measures of productivity and sustainability are frequently higher in IPM-managed farms than non-IPM farms ( Côte et al., 2009 ; Ortiz et al., 2009 ; Sharma et al., 2015 ). These studies conclude that IPM techniques are yield efficient, environmentally friendly, and can be the foundation of sustainable cropping systems ( Hall et al., 2013 ). An over-reliance on pesticides has proven to be unsustainable, less cost effective, and less efficient for pest control ( Berg and Tam, 2012 ; Rasmussen et al., 2012 ; Alam, 2013 ; Rodrigo et al., 2013 ).">
