Nests and hives: When you can see hives and nests around your house, it means that there are a lot of pests doing their grunt work. The primary method is to promote beneficial insects that consume or parasitize target pests.</p>
<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, lawn, or indoor area to prevent pests from ending up being a threat.
