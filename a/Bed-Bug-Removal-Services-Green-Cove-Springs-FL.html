<p>Throughout multiple outreach conferences and field tours organized exclusively for the general public in Southern California during the previous couple of years, it appeared that a bulk was not aware of farming systems, had misinterpreting about sustainable agriculture, and believed that organic food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished survey data).</p>
<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to handle the crop, lawn, or indoor area to avoid pests from becoming a hazard. Considering that IPM is a complicated pest control process, not merely a series of practices, it is impossible to use one IPM definition for all foods and all areas of the nation.
