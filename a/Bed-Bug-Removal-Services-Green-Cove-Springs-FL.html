<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to handle the crop, lawn, or indoor area to avoid pests from becoming a hazard. Considering that IPM is a complicated pest control process, not merely a series of practices, it is impossible to use one IPM definition for all foods and all areas of the nation.
