<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) safeguards environment through elimination of unneeded pesticide applications. These specialists understand the effect of pesticides and ensure they utilize the correct ones (in the correct amount) and apply it in such a method that you and your family are exposed to little or no risk after the application. Since 2003, the majority of new pesticide registrations have met criteria set by EPA for lowered danger" consisting of lower threats to human health and non-target organisms, and lower potential for contamination of groundwater, surface area water, and other ecological resources.</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement. If your facility presently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be surprised to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Study Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to recognize, handle, and minimize threat from pests and pest management tools and techniques in a manner that minimizes general financial, health, and environmental threats.</p>
