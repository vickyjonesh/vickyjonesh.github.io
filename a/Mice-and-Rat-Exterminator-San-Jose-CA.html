<h2>How To Select the Qualified Pest Control Service in San Jose</h2>

<p>The most efficient method for controlling pests is to combine methods in an approach referred to as Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

The pest management market is large, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and approximately 150,000 pest control service workers.
