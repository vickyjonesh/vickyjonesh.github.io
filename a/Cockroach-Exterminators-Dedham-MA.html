<p>The term "integrated" was therefore associated with "compatible." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring indicated that a pest population had reached a level (the financial limit) that needed treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which financial losses would go beyond the cost of the control measures.</p>
