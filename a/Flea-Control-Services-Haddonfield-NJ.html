<p>Screens, drifting row covers, or food containers with tight-fitting lids which serve as barriers to pests. Pest control is the regulation and management of any species which comes under the definition of pests. One risk of using pesticides is that pests might develop resistance, which indicates the pesticide is no longer reliable.

<p>Biological pest control steps benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs initial job is to establish appropriate pest levels, called action limits, and apply controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these limits and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to prevent unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even repair structural damage brought on by termites.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides harmful to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely impact natural opponents than materials that are selective or narrow-spectrum for specific insect species or life phases. </p>
<p>Stay watchful and call your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop varieties typically inadvertently develop conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest types which have tired deeper into bigger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to act like an intrusive species presented to a new location when resources abound (that is, people without resistance) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or signed up products to use in management (such as federally approved medications).</p>
