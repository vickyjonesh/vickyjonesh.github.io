The chemical controls are used just after routine tracking suggests that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level.

<p>The first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, appropriate watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the environment as a whole and considers a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control approaches to produce the most efficient and least damaging plan.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of integrating the use of other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later expanded to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been picked either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have greater levels of resistance. </p>
