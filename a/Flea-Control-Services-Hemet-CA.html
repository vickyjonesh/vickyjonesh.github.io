<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control family insect pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about decreasing pesticide usage. If all other incorporated pest management tactics are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic threshold, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and prevent financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Link to PRI's Pest Management Bulletins to find out about low-impact approaches of pest control that reduce pesticide usage and direct exposure. When you work with a pest control company, you are free to invest that time doing other important things.
