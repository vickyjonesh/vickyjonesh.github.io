All available approaches of insect-pest management and control must be thought about. Ecological impacts like dry spell stress affects pest management suggestions. This handbook is part of a training course on Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Sustainable biological, physical and other non-chemical techniques must be preferred to chemical approaches if they provide acceptable pest control.</p>
