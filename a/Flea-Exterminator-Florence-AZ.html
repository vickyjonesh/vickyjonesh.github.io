Trap crops are planted to hold and attract pest insects where they can be managed more effectively and prevent or lower their motion onto valuable crops.

<p>Biological pest control steps benefit from the hierarchy within nature. IPM programs preliminary job is to develop acceptable pest levels, called action thresholds, and use controls where the thresholds are crossed. Knowledge of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural opponents helps to avoid unnecessary (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage triggered by termites.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly achieve levels at which damage is caused thus ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms removing landscapes bare). For instance, a wealthy neighborhood likely will have a great deal of large, expensive homes, so pest control expenses could be higher there since there's more area for a pest control company to cover in among those houses. </p>
<p>Using info about pests' biology and habits, together with a toolbox of pest management strategies, pest control workers find, recognize, and get rid of pests. However due to the fact that these "sex" traps attract mainly male insects, they aren't very efficient controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, chemical and biological control of pest. A regular tracking program is the basis of IPM choice making, regardless of the control strategies used.</p>
