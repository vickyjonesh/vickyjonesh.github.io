Integrated pest management (IPM) is a technique that avoids pest damage with minimum negative impact on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>If a pest or disease causes unacceptable damage despite preventative efforts, choose a reliable management method that will have the least quantity of impact on other living animals and the environment.
