IPM holds that erasing an entire pest population is typically difficult, and the effort can be costly and environmentally hazardous. Baits offer control over an extended amount of time, less item is required and can be used in sensitive environments (e.g. cooking areas, schools, etc).</p>
<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western damaged plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not remove since growers were not prepared for such an intercropping arrangement.
