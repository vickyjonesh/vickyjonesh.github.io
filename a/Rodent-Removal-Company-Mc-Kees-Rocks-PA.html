If a lot of the pests are killed, then any that have resistance to the chemical will form the genetic basis of the future, more resistant, population. While chemical pesticides need to be used as the last resort, in concept, sometimes they are the very first line of defense to prevent the area-wide spread of certain endemic or intrusive pests and diseases or to protect the seed and transplants from common and persistent pest issues.</p>
<p>IPM is the holistic usage of all available plant defense methods and subsequent combination of suitable steps to discourage the advancement of pest, disease and weed populations. They have imposed rigid guidelines on making use of deadly chemicals and extremely hazardous services and products that might pose a danger to the environment.
